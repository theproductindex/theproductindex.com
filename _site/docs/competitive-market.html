    <p>A big part of product management is making sure that the market you’re attempting to address is large enough to make it worth going into.</p>

<p>Understanding market size, and understanding your ability to penetrate that market, is all-important. If your market is too small, you can’t make money, no matter how innovative the product or how competitive your pricing is. Top down and bottom up analyses are two basic ways to evaluate that market.</p>

<h2 id="bottom-up-based-on-current-trends-conservative">Bottom-up: Based on current trends (Conservative)</h2>

<p>A <em>bottom-up</em> analysis starts by estimating potential sales to determine a total sales figure. A bottom up analysis evaluates where products can be sold, the sales of comparable products, and the slice of current sales you can carve out. While it takes a lot more effort, the result is usually much more accurate.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Ask yourself where people currently buy / solve / pay for a similar solution</li>
  <li>Look for the sales volume for existing solutions. You may think that there’s nothing similar around, but in reality there’s probably things at least slightly similar.</li>
  <li>Make a conservative assumption and calculate the percentage that you could get from the sales they in a specific timeframe.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is a more accurate approach because it looks at patterns that exist in sales today rather than the total market</li>
  <li>This is the best way to do it as a Product Manager</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>It takes a little more effort and takes a bit longer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="top-down-based-on-total-market-size-optimistic">Top-down: Based on total market size (Optimistic)</h3>

<p>A <em>top-down</em> analysis starts by determining the total market, then estimating your share of that market.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Calculate the current Total Addresable Market (TAM), i.e. “I will sell a widget everyone can use at $1 and there are 300,000 people in my area”)</li>
  <li>Make an assumption of the percentage you can get of that TAM, i.e. “I could manage to get 5% of that market”.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to make assumptions on how much market penetration you will have inside that market.</li>
  <li>It’s not the most respected way of estimating the potential market.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="competitors">Competitors</h2>

<p>The most important thing is to capture all the players in the field. Use any tool to record every competitor that you find, known and unknown. As a product manager, you should already know who your biggest competitors are.</p>

<h3 id="finding-competitors">Finding competitors</h3>

<p>Sometimes, there are competitors that might not be that obvious. In order to find them, use any of these techniques:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search exactly how the user would complain about her problem</li>
  <li>Search on specific sites where people talk about their problems: Reddit, Quora, Yahoo Answers</li>
  <li>Search exact phrases of your one-line pitch</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="categories-of-competitors">Categories of competitors</h3>

<p><strong>Direct</strong>
These target the same customer group as your company. They solve the same problem and have similar solution and price as your company. You need to be competitive with them since customers will have to decide between you and them.</p>

<p><strong>Indirect</strong>
These solve the same problem as your company but in a different way. Their target customer group might overlap. Make sure you don’t loose too many customers to them.</p>

<p><strong>Potential</strong>
Also called “peripherical competitors”, they don’t adress the same problem as your company but they target the same customer group. Make sure they can’t do the switch easily.</p>

<p><strong>Substitute</strong>
They solve the same core problem but in a complete different way and for a different target group. Make sure your product is at least better than these.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-competitors">Understanding competitors</h3>

<p>A good part of what makes you successful as a product manager is your ability to keep track of your competitors and make sure that you are ahead of the curve and know what their next move is. Moreover, you have to have a deeper sense of what they can do.</p>

<p>The are five different dimensions that are absolutely crucial to understand about your competitors:</p>

<p><strong>The product core</strong>
You need to know how good is their product team. Whom are in charge of making products? How good is their engineering team?</p>

<p><strong>The user base</strong>
Having a large user base has its adventages: more chances of dominate the market on every release, getting press coverage and closing deals with other companies.</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong>
How well designed is their product. Do they use it as a differentiator?</p>

<p><strong>Brand</strong>
Learn how users perceive their brand. Having a strong brand is a huge competitive adventage: they can charge higher prices, get the benefit of doubt and have a higher level of customer loyalty.</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong>
If the company is small, they are more likely to move faster. How quickly they can build and ship?</p>

<h3 id="feature-table">Feature Table</h3>

<p>The feature table is a comparison chart we use to compare our product to our competitor’s product on a list of dimensions. This way you learn how competitive you are before launch a product.</p>

<p>You can use any tool to build one. On the X-axis put direct competitors. On the Y-axis put the features or characteristics you want to compare. If these doesn’t come to mind easily, you need to research your customer group and learn what’s important to them.</p>

<p>Make sure your customers find your solution obviously better than the rest knowing how your product differentiates. Also, pay close attention to the new features your competitors build and learn from them.</p>
