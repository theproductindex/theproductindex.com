  <div class="post-content">
    <p>A mental model is a representation of how something works for someone based on their context. Just as thoughts flow freely, mental models take different forms in different contexts, depending upon the person’s understanding of the world.</p>

<p>A popular analogy to mental models is that they are like tools in a toolbox. So, depending upon your need, you pick the tool to achieve the result efficiently.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look to a few that are relevant to the key aspects of product management — strategic decision making and understanding your team.</p>

<div class="table-of-content">

  </ul>
</div>

<h2 id="eisenhower-decision-matrix-urgent-vs-important">Eisenhower Decision Matrix (Urgent vs. Important)</h2>

<p>The idea behind this model is — you should be able to identify what urgency means exactly. By helping determine which task belongs in which quadrant, the matrix helps to prioritize, which is key to succeed as a product manager.</p>

<p><img src="images/eisenhower-box.png" alt="" title="Eisenhower Box" />
<span><a href="#resources">From James Clear article. Resources section</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important - Dwight Eisenhower</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the decision matrix above, you should separate your actions based on four possibilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Urgent and important</strong>: Tasks you should do immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Important, but not urgent</strong>: Tasks you should schedule to do later.</li>
  <li><strong>Urgent, but not important</strong>: Tasks you should delegate to someone else.</li>
  <li><strong>Neither urgent nor important</strong>: Tasks that you should eliminate.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the most common mistakes of new product managers is get caught on the urgent but not important tasks. Learn to delegate.</p>

<h2 id="the-inversion-principle">The Inversion Principle</h2>

<p>This mental model helps you visualize what <em>not to do</em> in order to be successful. Instead of focusing on how success would look like, invert it and think about how failure looks like and what needs to happen to get there. The process of using the Inversion Principle is very simple:</p>

<p><strong>Define the objective</strong>: What you are trying to do?
<strong>Invert it</strong>: What would you have to do to guarantee the failure of your objective?
<strong>Consider multiple solutions</strong>: What would you have to do to prevent that from happening?</p>

<p>Imagine the most important goal or project you are working on right now. Now fast forward months from now and assume the project or goal has failed miserable. Tell the story of how it happened and think:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What went wrong?</li>
  <li>What mistakes did you make?</li>
  <li>How did it fail?</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, think of the main reasons and root causes of why this went horribly wrong and work from it.</p>

<h2 id="emotional-intelligence">Emotional Intelligence</h2>

<p>The ability to recognize, express and control our emotions is essential. The same goes for understanding, interpreting and responding to other people’s emotions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For leaders, the first task in management has nothing to do with leading others; step one poses the challenge of knowing and managing oneself. - Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: To understand and take control of your moods and emotions. When you are aware of them, you are better equipped to take control of them and its effect on your peers.</p>

<p><strong>Self-management</strong>: To help you see if your motivation is intrinsic or driven by external factors like bonus or appreciation.</p>

<p><strong>Empathy</strong>: To understand what the other person is going through and treating them with compassion and care.</p>

<p><strong>Social Skills</strong>: To help you understand how to interact with your team and your ability to build relationships.</p>

<h2 id="perverse-incentives">Perverse incentives</h2>

<p>This model break the myths around monetized incentives to improve performance. It describes how such incentives can go awry, especially in situations where outcomes can be manipulated by people who have direct control over them.</p>

<p>A perverse incentive is an incentive that has an unintended and undesirable result or “cobra effect” which is contrary to the interests of the incentive makers.</p>
