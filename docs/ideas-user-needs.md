Typically, new ideas can come from anywhereâ€”company executives, discussions with customers, usability testing, your own product team, your sales or marketing staff, industry analysts, to name a few. But then the product manager needs to take a hard look at the idea and decide if it is something worth pursuing.

Despite popular belief, the product management job is not about being the "idea person".

## Where ideas come from

Great products solve painful problems. Feature ideas and requests usually come from four main places that we can easily remember using an acronym, EMUC.

**Employees**: This is just ideas coming in from your coworkers, management, and you yourself.
**Metrics**: This is just problems and inefficiencies you find when you're looking into how users use your product.
**Users**: This is user feedback from forums or emails to your company or yourself and social media. It's just everyone
out there that uses your product.
**Clients**: Not always the user is the client, meaning the person that paid for the product. Especially for B2B PMs.

Depending on what type of product manager you are, the volume of requests may change:

**Internal PMs**:
- Stakeholders

**Business to Consumer PMs**:
- Users
- Metrics
- Coworkers

**Business to Business PMs**:
- Employees
- Clients

Product ideas can come from internal or external:
  - Sale questions
  - Customer service calls
  - Data scientists observe use trends
  - Customers share their needs

How to cultivate ideas
  - Industry trends
  - Observe your competition
  
As a PM your rol is looks critically at product ideas and determine if is a good opportunity for the company and determine market opportunities.

## Getting Real User Needs

Once you have a list of ideas or feature requests, you need to learn first what's the real problem behind them. The biggest mistake you can make here is go and start building them.

People always ask in terms of solutions, because that's how our brains work and most of the time, they will seem reasonable requests. However, they don't know what's possible or the implications behind those requests so there's likely a better solution.

Being a product manager is all about finding a solution to a problem instead of trying to fit a problem to a solution that you or someone else has thought of in the first place.

There is an old technique that a lot of salespeople use and have worked for a long time: ask why. And then you ask why at least two more times. Eventually, you will get to the core problem.

### Customers vs. Users

More often than not, the people that will pay for the product, your customers, are not the same people that use it, your users.

You need to keep this in mind when collecting feedback. The customers that pay for the product will give you feedback about general features and users will give you feedback about technical issues and usability since they actually use the product.
