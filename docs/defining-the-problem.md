We all know examples of failed products and companies. A [CBInsights report](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/) shows that the number one reason is failing to meet customer needs. Their focus was on the specific solution rather than the underlying problem. This is also known as failing to find [Product-Market Fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit).

Product Managers need to understand which customer needs their product is solving. These unserved needs, for a specific target customer, define the market. They can target those needs but they cannot change nor control them. This is often called the *problem space*.

Mastering the problem space is the single most important thing to avoid the "building trap".

## Problem Space vs. Solution Space

The problem space is where the needs of your target customer live. These can be anything from pain points, desires, or jobs-to-be-done. They usually cluster in different market segments.

The solution space, by contrast, includes any specific implementation that aims to solve the problem. It can be any product or representation of a product — like a prototype — built for customer use.

> Customers don’t care about your solution. They care about their problems - Dave McClure

Years of experience tell us that getting clearly defined needs from customers is rare. We shouldn’t expect to get a clear statement of what they need but we might get what they want. And they are usually conflicting. This is how the human brain works. We have a natural tendency to think in terms of solutions.

The job of a Product Manager is to read between lines within the solution space and attempt to define the problem space.

## The Product/Market Fit Pyramid

Marc Andreesen coined the term Product/Market Fit as *"being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market"* in a well-known [blog post](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html). However, this doesn't say much about how to actually get there.

[Dan Olsen](https://dan-olsen.com/), fortunately, created a framework called *Product/Market Fit Pyramid* which gives us a more hands-on approach.

The framework defines five key components into layers. Each layer depends on the layer beneath. To move up, you need to confirm existing hypothesis in the working layer:

<span>[From Dan Olsen's book. Resources section.](#resources)</span>

1. **Target Customer**: Who are they?
2. **Underserved Needs**: What are their needs?
3. **Value Proposition**: How the customer benefits from our product? How our product is better?
4. **Feature Set**: What's the functionality that supports those benefits?
5. **User Experience (UX)**: What the customer experience in order to get the benefits?

> Fall in love with the problem, not the solution, and the rest will follow - Uri Levine

The first three layers live in the problem space. The other two live in the solution space and are what customers interact with. Most of the time, we don't spend enough time in the base of the pyramid and jump too soon to the building (fun) part.

Product Managers should always remember how their work ties back to solving a real customer problem.

## Assessing Product Opportunities (POA)

This tool was introduced by Marty Cagan in his book Inspired. The goal of the Opportunity Assessment (POA) is twofold:

- Prevent the company from wasting time and money
- Understand and define what success looks like

As technology evolves, what is possible is always changing. That means new product ideas are also changing. The POA helps Product Managers to evaluate whether an opportunity is promising or not. The problem is not the lack of opportunities. The problem is to pursue the ones that worth it. Moreover, to do it fairly quickly and effectively.

Sometimes good ideas are just not ready for productization today,  but they might be in the near future. Here is a list of the questions you should ask yourself to make an informed decision:

1. Exactly what problem will this solve? *Value proposition*.
2. For whom do we solve that problem? *Target market*.
3. How big is the opportunity? *Market size*.
4. How will we measure success? *Metrics*.
5. What alternatives are out there now? *Competitive landscape*.
6. Why are we best suited to pursue this? *Unique differentiator*.
7. Why now? *Timing*.
8. How will we get this product to market? *Go-to-market strategy*.
9. What factors are critical to success? *Solution requirements*.

If you think the first three questions are the hardest to answer, you’re right. But it is critical that as a Product Manager you can communicate a compelling problem statement and the size of the opportunity.
