Experiments can provide valuable insights for your product. However, many companies run experiments without gaining any real insights which propel the product forward or achieve any interesting, insightful results.

Experiments should be run to try and find insights into problems and answers to interesting questions which help the company to achieve their goals.

For startups, small optimization projects just don’t make sense. The the time, money and headspace spent trying to tweak something that yet have to prove their worth is better spent elsewhere.

## Opportunities  

When it comes for specific opportunities, try to balance between acquisition and retention opportunities. If a growth opportunity is not paying off anywhere near expectations, fail fast and try some other ones.

Consistent 1% improvements over time will yield larger and larger absolute increases in performance. Growth is the judicious, iterative improvement of all of the parts of your business that need to be improved, while maintaining a holistic sense of how all the parts fit together.

Creating a growth mindset and applying a set of growth best practices is the way to systematically shifting your odds in favor.

## Avoid snacking

Snacking is the *attractive* low-effort, low-impact work. It feels rewarding and can solve a short term problem, but if you never eat anything of substance it can kill you. By continually picking up the low-hanging fruit, the branches will stop growing, so this work dries up quickly as your product and team matures.

The wasted time compounds a lot quicker than the insignificant results. Do this enough times and you’ll grow a low impact team that doesn’t achieve anything.

## Talk to customers

It doesn't matter how much you look like the customer, you have way too much knowledge about this problem to assume that the way you do it is the way other people do it. How can you learn if you’re not putting your product in front of users?

An experiment can tell you what’s going on, but it’s not going to tell you why. And that's how you master the problem space. You really need to talk to your users.

## Designing and Running Experiments

In order to learn from your experiments, you need to spend time upfront creating experiments that will deliver conclusive results at the end.

Don't stress yourself if you read an A/B test that guarantees a 5% lift in conversions. It never happens. Like wearing someone else's glasses, they weren’t meant for you.

### Assumptions

An assumption is something we believe is generally true with absolutely no evidence. It’s something we take for granted when thinking about the problem.

You want to make a list of all your assumptions and choose the ones that, if not true, will make your product fail. If they prove to be wrong you still have time to go back to the drawing board and pivot or move to another project.

Some examples of common assumptions:
- My customers has problem x,y,z
- My customers care about x
- My customer would pay for solution x
- There are no satisfactory substitutes

Usually, the riskiest assumption is the one that states that your customers have a specific problem that you're trying to solve. If that assumption turns out to be false, then they won't care about your product/solution.

### Hypotheses

A hypothesis it’s a statement of what you believe is true. A hypothesis brings clarity not only to you, but the rest of your team. If you skip this stage, you run the risk of forgetting what exactly you're trying to do in the first place.

When building new products, this basic template for writing hyphotheses works great:

> **We believe** [subject/target]  **will** [predicted action] **because** [reason]

As a product managers in established companies with existing products, there's a more specific way of thinking about hyphotheses:

> **We believe** [subject/target] **has a** [problem] **because** [reason]. **If we do** [action], **this** [metric] **will improve** 

The main difference between assumptions and hyphotheses is that hyphotheses are actionable. They also have a target customer group, an expected outcome and a strategy to get customers to behave in specific way.

### Minimum Criteria of Success (MCS)

It's critical that you establish a Minimum Criteria of Success (MCS) in order to decide whether your product is worth building. It provides clarity and meaning.

A big percentage of all the experiments you are going to run are going to end up in “somewhere in the middle” between "true" and "false". This means that if you don't define a MCS beforehand, you won't be able to decide objectively.

In order to set your MCS, take into account the cost / reward relation of the experiment.

###  The Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

> A Minimum Viable Product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect a maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort - Eric Ries, The Lean Startup

The goal of the MVP is to quickly get feedback from customers and improve the product without having to invest a lot of time or money that could potentially go to waste.

The important part is "validated learning", which means learning from a scientific experiment where you are not biasing your customers.

<span>[From Dan Olsen's book. Resources section.](#resources)</span>

The Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop is at the core of the Lean Startup model. The effort should be focused on minimizing the total time through this feedback loop. The less time needed, the more experiments we can run in the same time which leads to a better product.

MVPs will return quantitative data primarily that indicates user behaviour. Use this data as input to find which users are you going to talk to. You need qualitative data from these interviews to understand why the MVP worked or not and make the right decisions.

#### Techniques

> Fake it till you make it

Since you need validated learning from real customers, you need to make sure they think the real product is ready or at least comming soon. How far you can go will determine which type of MVP fits best.

* Email MVP
* Shadow button
* 404 / Coming soon
* Explainer videos
* Fake landing page / Pitch experiment
* Concierge
* Piecemeal
* Wizard of oz

**Final Considerations**:
- Larger organizations have the resources to weather failed products
- Some companies care a lot about how their brand is affected
- Startups can use all their resources for MVPs
- Always consider the opportunity cost of running an experiment over another
